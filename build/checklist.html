            <h1>Move-in Checklist</h1>

            <h2>Take the Guesswork Out of Your Move</h2>

            <p>Moving into a new property often proves stressful, which is why we at Ethosity Property Management have created these useful moving checklists. The checklists cover many of the most common responsibilities associated with moving into a new home. Whether you're arriving at Ethosity or you're leaving one of our properties, the information below should help make your move as seamless as possible.</p>

            <p>Still have questions? Don't hesitate to give us a call: (888) 212-3764</p>

            <h2>Move-in Checklist</h2>
            <p>We're always happy to welcome new tenants to one of our properties. We hope you'll enjoy your stay. Start your tenancy off on the right foot by following the steps outlined below.</p>

            <h3>First Month's Rent & Security Deposit</h3>
            <p>Both your first month's rent and the security deposit are due at the lease signing. If any additional deposits, such as a pet deposit are necessary, these will also be due at the lease signing. Please confirm the amounts with a member of our team, as well as the payment method, before the signing.</p>

            <h3>Move-in Date & Inspection</h3>
            <p>Your move-in date will be scheduled during the lease signing. If an inspection needs to take place with you, we'll let you know during the signing.</p>

            <h3>Utilities</h3>
            <p>Utilities must be placed in the name of the leaseholder several days before taking possession of the property. We recommend calling the utility company at least five days in advance. Failure to quickly put the accounts in order may result in administrative fees or temporary outages.</p>

            <h1>Move-out Checklist</h1>
            <p>We always hate to say goodbye to our tenants, but we want to make your departure as easy as possible. Be sure to take care of the following steps before leaving.</p>

            <h3>Notice of Intent to Vacate</h3>
            <p>The length of your stay is clearly defined in your lease. If you intend to leave your rental home for any reason, you must provide written notice of your intent to vacate. Please refer to your lease terms for any conditions.</p>

            <h3>Property Condition</h3>
            <p>The rental property must be returned to its original condition before you return the keys.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rental Cleaning: Vacuum and sweep the floors of your rental home. All hard surfaces should be mopped. You'll also need to wipe down cupboards, appliances, and lighting fixtures. Please pay extra attention to areas such as the bathrooms and kitchen. If your home hasn't been properly cleaned, we'll need to schedule a professional visit and you will be charged for this expense.</li>
                <li>Landscaping & Outdoor Areas: If your home has outdoor space, you need to address any landscaping and general maintenance responsibilities, such as mowing the lawn, removing the trash, and replacing bulbs in outdoor fixtures.</li>
                <li>Repairs: If any damage occurred during your visit, please take the time to fix the problem. Patch nail and screw holes and replace broken fixtures. If you've painted during your stay, you may also need to repaint your walls.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Security Deposit</h3>
            <p>Your security deposit will be returned as soon as possible after you vacate the premises. We will conduct a final inspection and identify any damage in the home. If repairs are necessary, will deduct the expenses from your deposit.<br> Please remember, you'll need to pay your last month's rentâ€”your deposit cannot serve as a rent payment. </p>
